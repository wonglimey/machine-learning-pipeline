# scikit-learn-pipeline
This is a Python project that describe building a machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn libraries. Here, we make use of the Pipeline class of scikit-learn to list and run transformer and predictors in sequence.



## Getting Started

1. Run **train_pipeline.py** to train the logistic regression model.
3. Run **score.py** to predict and display the model accuracy. The test accuracy is approximately 0.6832.
